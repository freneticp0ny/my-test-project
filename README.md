These fun facts about cats will make you feel all fuzzy inside.

- A cat with a question-mark-shaped tail is asking, “Want to play?”
- According to Wilde, a slow blink is a “kitty kiss.” This movement shows contentment and trust.
- Cats have a unique “vocabulary” with their owner — each cat has a different set of vocalizations, purrs and behaviors.
- Cats have up to 100 different vocalizations — dogs only have 10.
- Cats find it threatening when you make direct eye contact with them.
- Cats mark you as their territory when they rub their faces and bodies against you, as they have scent glands in those areas.
